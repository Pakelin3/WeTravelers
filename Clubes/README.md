## Quick Start Demo Deployment Using XAMPP

1. Download PHP server.  Use a server such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to be able to host the demo code sample.
2. Browse to the `htdocs` directory of XAMPP. Unzip the downloaded demo code folder and place it in this `htdocs` directory.
3. Start the Apache server in XAMPP from the XAMPP control panel.
4. Open the website in the browser and access it as: `http://<your_domain>/<php_code_folder_name>/index.php`
   Here, `your_domain` will be localhost if hosting on your local machine.
   The `php_code_folder_name` is the name of the folder under which the downloaded code resides.
5. Read further instructions when `index.php` in opened in a browser.

1. If you have a newer version of XAMPP, launch the XAMPP control panel. In the General tab, click on Start to start the XAMPP stack.
2. In the Services tab, start the Apache service.
3. In the Volumes tab, click on Mount to mount the `/opt/lampp` volume. Then click on Explore which will launch the file explorer. Go to `htdocs` directory there and unzip the downloaded code sample there.
4. In the Network tab, enable port forwarding for  `localhost:8080 -> 80 (over SSH)`.
5. Next, open your browser and go to the `localhost:8080/<Code sample folder name here>/`  to launch the web application.
